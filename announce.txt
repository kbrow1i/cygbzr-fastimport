bzr-fastimport-0.13.0-1 has been added to the Cygwin distribution.

Bazaar Fast Import is a plugin providing fast loading of revision control data into Bazaar.  It is designed to be used in combination with front-end programs that generate a command/data stream for it to process.  Front-ends are available for a wide range of foreign VCS tools including Subversion, CVS, Git, Mercurial, Darcs, and Perforce.  New front-ends are easy to develop in whatever programming language you prefer, making Bazaar Fast Import useful for teams needing a custom migration solution.

bzr-fastimport includes, among other things, a fast-export command that can be used for migrating from Bazaar to a different version-control system.  See
